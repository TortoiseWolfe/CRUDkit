## 1. Product Requirements

### What We're Building

A complete Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) workflow implementation following Cole Medlin's context engineering methodology. This will enable the team to generate comprehensive implementation blueprints for features using SpecKit's Docker processing combined with AI enhancement.

### Why We're Building It

- Constitutional requirement (Section 2 & 3: PRP‚ÜíSpec‚ÜíImplementation)
- Currently marked as "‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED - Sprint 3 Priority"
- Essential for structured feature development
- Reduces AI hallucinations through context engineering
- Improves first-pass implementation quality

### Success Criteria

- [ ] PRP workflow integrated with SpecKit Docker processing
- [ ] Templates and examples available in prp/templates/
- [ ] Inbox/Outbox/Archive directory structure functional
- [ ] Documentation showing the iterative process
- [ ] At least 3 example PRPs generated from constitution
- [ ] Workflow script to automate the process

### Out of Scope

- Fully automated PRP generation without human review
- Integration with external project management tools
- PRP versioning system (use git for now)

## 2. Context & Codebase Intelligence

### Existing Patterns to Follow

#### SpecKit Integration

```powershell
# Current script at: .specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1
# Processes constitution and generates basic specs
docker compose exec speckit pwsh -File /workspace/.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1
```

#### Directory Structure Already Created

```
docs/spec-kit/prp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inbox/          # New PRPs awaiting review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outbox/         # Approved PRPs ready for processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/        # Completed PRPs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/      # PRP template (already exists)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/       # Web3Forms example (already exists)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # Documentation (already exists)
```

#### Workflow Documentation

```markdown
# Already documented at: docs/spec-kit/SPECIFY_WORKFLOW.md

# Shows the iterative process with human review points
```

### Dependencies & Libraries

- Docker and Docker Compose (already configured)
- PowerShell 7.4.6 (installed in Dockerfile.speckit)
- SpecKit initialized with .specify directory
- No additional npm packages needed

### File Structure

```
docs/spec-kit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPECIFY_WORKFLOW.md    # Complete workflow documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WORKFLOW.md            # Sprint workflow with PRP integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate-prp.sh        # NEW: Automation script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prp/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Already updated with correct definition
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/         # Template already exists
```

## 3. Technical Specifications

### Workflow Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# generate-prp.sh - Automate PRP generation from constitution

# 1. Run SpecKit processing
docker compose exec speckit pwsh -File /workspace/.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 \
  -InputFilePath /workspace/constitution.md \
  -FeatureName "Sprint-${1:-3}"

# 2. Extract and display features for review
echo "SpecKit processing complete. Review output at:"
echo ".specify/features/Sprint-${1:-3}/spec.md"

# 3. Prompt for PRP generation
echo "Identify major features and generate PRPs in prp/inbox/"
```

### Data Models

```typescript
// PRP metadata structure (for future automation)
interface PRPMetadata {
  featureName: string;
  priority: 'P0' | 'P1' | 'P2';
  sprint: string;
  status: 'inbox' | 'outbox' | 'archive';
  created: string;
  author: string;
  constitutionSection: string;
}
```

### State Management

- File-based state using directory structure
- Git for version control and history
- Manual review process (no database needed)

### Performance Requirements

- Script execution: < 30 seconds
- PRP generation: < 5 minutes per feature
- Review cycle: < 1 hour per sprint

---

## 4. Implementation Runbook

### Step 1: Create Workflow Script

```bash
# Create the automation script
cat > docs/spec-kit/generate-prp.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# SpecKit + PRP Generation Workflow

echo "üöÄ Starting SpecKit + PRP Workflow"

# Ensure container is running
docker compose up -d speckit

# Copy constitution to workspace
cp ../constitution.md .

# Run SpecKit processing
echo "üì¶ Processing constitution with SpecKit..."
docker compose exec speckit pwsh -File /workspace/.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 \
  -InputFilePath /workspace/constitution.md \
  -FeatureName "Sprint-3-Planning"

echo "‚úÖ SpecKit processing complete!"
echo ""
echo "üìã Review the output at: .specify/features/Sprint-3-Planning/spec.md"
echo ""
echo "üîç Next steps:"
echo "1. Review SpecKit output"
echo "2. Identify major features needing PRPs"
echo "3. Generate PRPs using the template"
echo "4. Move approved PRPs to outbox/"
EOF

chmod +x docs/spec-kit/generate-prp.sh
```

### Step 2: Document the Process

- Update WORKFLOW.md with script usage
- Add examples to SPECIFY_WORKFLOW.md
- Create quick-start guide

### Step 3: Generate Example PRPs

Using the SpecKit output, generate PRPs for:

1. PWA Background Sync
2. Cookie Consent/GDPR
3. Visual Regression Testing

### Step 4: Testing

- [ ] Run workflow script successfully
- [ ] Generate at least 3 PRPs
- [ ] Move PRPs through inbox ‚Üí outbox ‚Üí archive
- [ ] Verify documentation is clear

---

## 5. Validation Loops

### Pre-Implementation Checks

- [x] SpecKit Docker container working
- [x] PowerShell scripts accessible
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Templates available

### During Implementation

- [ ] Script executes without errors
- [ ] SpecKit output is readable
- [ ] PRPs follow template structure
- [ ] Review process is smooth

### Post-Implementation

- [ ] All Sprint 3 features have PRPs
- [ ] Workflow documented completely
- [ ] Team can use workflow independently
- [ ] Integration with SpecKit verified

## 6. Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks

1. **Risk**: SpecKit script is too basic
   **Mitigation**: Use it for structure, enhance with AI

2. **Risk**: Manual process is slow
   **Mitigation**: Create script to automate repetitive parts

3. **Risk**: PRPs become outdated
   **Mitigation**: Archive old PRPs, regenerate for each sprint

4. **Risk**: Team doesn't adopt workflow
   **Mitigation**: Provide clear documentation and examples
