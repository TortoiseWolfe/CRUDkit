## Lessons Learned

### What Works

- PRP methodology provides clear implementation path
- TDD approach ensures quality (98% coverage on forms)
- Docker-first development ensures consistency
- Automated task tracking saves time
- Component generator enforces standards
- Hook-level mocking simplifies integration tests

### Challenges Solved

- React 19 compatibility issues
- pnpm version consistency across CI/CD
- Docker permission issues
- Webpack cache corruption
- Component structure standardization
- Service Worker dual queue processing (IndexedDB + cache)
- React Hook Form async validation in tests (4 known issues)

### Process Improvements

- /plan and /tasks commands streamline workflow
- Parallel task execution speeds completion
- Pre-commit hooks catch issues early
- ADRs track decision rationale
- Small, focused phases prevent scope creep
- Document known test issues for future resolution

### PRP-011 Specific Lessons

- **Testing Complex Forms**: React Hook Form validation timing differs between test and browser environments
- **Service Worker Updates**: Version stamping forces SW updates reliably
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock at highest reasonable level (hooks vs utilities)
- **Documentation**: Create known issues doc when tests fail but production works
- **Future Approach**: Split integration tests into unit + E2E for better reliability
