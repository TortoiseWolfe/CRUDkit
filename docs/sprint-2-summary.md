## Key Metrics

### Performance

- **Web Vitals**: All metrics in "good" range
- **Lighthouse Scores**: 92/98/95/100/92
- **Bundle Size**: 450KB total, 88KB first load JS
- **Test Coverage**: 58% statements

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Linting**: ESLint configured with Next.js rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier with Tailwind CSS plugin
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit and pre-push validation

### Infrastructure

- **CI/CD**: Automated testing, building, and accessibility checks
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, performance tracking, Web Vitals
- **Documentation**: ADRs, testing guidelines, contribution guide
- **Automation**: Task completion tracking, deployment history

## Technical Debt Addressed

1. **React 19 Compatibility**: Resolved TypeScript issues with React.cloneElement
2. **Form Validation**: Eliminated prop drilling with proper validation patterns
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Moved from no tests to comprehensive coverage
4. **Accessibility**: Added Pa11y testing to prevent regressions
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Implemented Web Vitals tracking

## Challenges Overcome

1. **React 19 Breaking Changes**: Refactored components to eliminate cloneElement usage
2. **Task Automation**: Created script to automatically track task completion
3. **Integration Testing**: Set up proper test environment for component interactions
4. **Docker Performance**: Fixed HMR issues for better development experience

## Next Steps (Sprint 3)

Based on the foundation we've built, Sprint 3 should focus on:

1. **Advanced Components**: Build on the atomic design system
2. **Data Layer**: Implement state management and data fetching
3. **User Features**: Authentication, user preferences, data persistence
4. **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, optimization
5. **Testing**: Increase coverage to 80%, add E2E tests with Playwright

## Lessons Learned

1. **Automation is Key**: Task tracking automation saved significant time
2. **Quality Gates Work**: Pre-commit/push hooks caught issues early
3. **Documentation Matters**: ADRs help track decision rationale
4. **Incremental Progress**: Small, focused phases lead to steady progress
5. **Testing First**: Early test setup makes development more confident

## Team Notes

The foundation is now solid with:

- Robust testing infrastructure
- Automated quality checks
- Performance monitoring
- Accessibility testing
- Clear documentation

This positions CRUDkit well for rapid feature development in future sprints while maintaining high quality standards.
