# Sprint 3: Build the Experience - Planning

## Sprint Overview

**Planned Duration**: 8 weeks  
**Priority**: Enhance user experience and add core features  
**Prerequisites**: Sprint 2 foundation (testing, quality, monitoring)

## Sprint Goals

1. Implement advanced component library
2. Add state management and data persistence
3. Create user authentication system
4. Enhance performance and optimization
5. Achieve 80% test coverage

## Proposed Phases

### Phase 1: Component Library Expansion (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Create molecular components (Header, Footer, Navigation)
- [ ] Implement complex organisms (Dashboard, DataTable, Forms)
- [ ] Add animation library (Framer Motion or React Spring)
- [ ] Create component composition patterns
- [ ] Document component API and usage

### Phase 2: State Management (Week 3-4)

- [ ] Evaluate and implement state solution (Zustand/Jotai/Context)
- [ ] Create global state for theme, user preferences
- [ ] Implement local storage persistence
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Create state debugging tools

### Phase 3: Authentication & User Features (Week 5-6)

- [ ] Implement authentication system (NextAuth.js or custom)
- [ ] Add user profile management
- [ ] Create role-based access control
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add social login options

### Phase 4: Performance & Optimization (Week 7)

- [ ] Implement code splitting strategies
- [ ] Add lazy loading for components
- [ ] Optimize images with Next.js Image
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for lists
- [ ] Add service worker enhancements

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Week 8)

- [ ] Add Playwright for E2E testing
- [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add interactive examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Key Features to Implement

### Components

- DataTable with sorting, filtering, pagination
- Advanced form builder with validation
- Modal system with portal rendering
- Toast/notification system
- Command palette (âŒ˜K)

### User Experience

- Dark/light mode auto-detection
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Responsive design patterns
- Loading states and skeletons
- Error recovery flows

### Developer Experience

- Component generator CLI
- Visual regression testing
- Bundle analysis dashboard
- Performance budgets
- API mocking system

## Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 80% (up from 58%)
- **Lighthouse Performance**: 95+ (up from 92)
- **Bundle Size**: < 400KB (down from 450KB)
- **Component Count**: 30+ production-ready components
- **Documentation**: 100% of public APIs documented

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep**: Strictly prioritize P0 tasks
2. **Performance Regression**: Continuous monitoring with budgets
3. **Breaking Changes**: Comprehensive test suite
4. **Complexity Growth**: Regular refactoring sessions
5. **Documentation Lag**: Docs-as-code approach

## Dependencies

- Sprint 2 completion (foundation)
- Design system finalization
- API specification (if backend planned)
- User research/feedback incorporation

## Team Allocation

Suggested focus areas:

- **Frontend**: Component development, animations
- **Backend**: Authentication, API design
- **Testing**: E2E setup, coverage improvement
- **DevOps**: Performance monitoring, CI/CD enhancement
- **Documentation**: User guides, API docs

## Definition of Done

Each feature is complete when:

- [ ] Implementation meets requirements
- [ ] Unit tests written (80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Storybook story created
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Accessibility validated
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Notes

This sprint focuses on transforming the solid foundation from Sprint 2 into a rich, user-friendly application. The emphasis is on creating reusable patterns and components that can accelerate future development.

Priority should be given to features that:

1. Enhance developer productivity
2. Improve user experience
3. Maintain performance standards
4. Support future scalability
