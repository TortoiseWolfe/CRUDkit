# Spec Kit Sprint Workflow

## Overview

This document describes the iterative sprint workflow for using GitHub Spec Kit with Claude Code to continuously evolve the CRUDkit project.

## Sprint Methodology

We use an **Agile-inspired sprint cycle** with Spec Kit as our planning framework. Each sprint:

- Lasts 1-2 weeks
- Has clear deliverables defined in TASKS.md
- Archives historical documents for reference
- Evolves the constitution based on learnings

## Sprint Workflow Process

### 1. Sprint Planning (Day 1)

**Review Previous Sprint**

```bash
# Read the previous sprint summary
cat docs/spec-kit/archive/sprint-XXX/SPRINT_SUMMARY.md
```

**Update Constitution**

- Review lessons learned
- Update principles based on experience
- Version the constitution (semver)

```bash
# Edit with Claude Code
"Claude, update the constitution.md based on our sprint-001 learnings"
```

### 2. Specification Phase (Day 1-2)

**Process Constitution with SpecKit**

```bash
# Navigate to spec-kit directory
cd docs/spec-kit

# Feed constitution to SpecKit Docker container
docker cp ../constitution.md speckit-dev:/workspace/constitution.md

# Run SpecKit processing
docker compose exec speckit pwsh -File /workspace/.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 \
  -InputFilePath /workspace/constitution.md \
  -FeatureName "Sprint-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

**Generate PRPs from SpecKit Output**

```bash
# Review what SpecKit generated
docker compose exec speckit cat /workspace/.specify/features/Sprint-*/spec.md

# Use AI to identify features and generate PRPs
"Claude, analyze this SpecKit output and generate PRPs for major features"
```

**Create Enhanced Specification**

```
# With PRPs now generated and reviewed:
/specify Create enhanced Sprint-002 specification using:
  - SpecKit output from .specify/features/
  - PRPs from prp/outbox/
  - Updated constitution.md

# The AI will generate a comprehensive spec.md file
# Save the output to docs/spec-kit/spec.md
```

**Human Review Point** üîç

- Review spec.md
- Verify PRPs are properly incorporated
- Ensure alignment with SpecKit's analysis
- Edit to add/remove features

### 3. Planning Phase (Day 2)

**Generate Technical Plan with PRPs**

```
# PRPs were generated from SpecKit output, now use them:
/plan Create technical implementation plan based on:
  - spec.md (enhanced specification)
  - All PRPs in prp/outbox/
  - SpecKit analysis from .specify/features/

# The AI will generate a detailed PLAN.md that incorporates:
# - Technical requirements from PRPs
# - Implementation patterns from PRPs
# - Validation criteria from PRPs

# Review and save to docs/spec-kit/PLAN.md
```

**Human Review Point** üîç

- Review technical architecture
- Adjust technology choices
- Refine component structure

**Note**: PRPs provide implementation context during planning phase

### 4. Task Generation (Day 2-3)

**Generate Task List**

```
# Use AI assistant command
/tasks Break down PLAN.md into actionable tasks

# The AI will generate TASKS.md with numbered items
# Review and save to docs/spec-kit/TASKS.md
```

**Human Review Point** üîç

- Reorder task priorities
- Add missing tasks
- Remove unnecessary items
- Estimate complexity

### 5. Implementation Phase (Days 3-10)

**Execute Tasks**

```bash
# Work through TASKS.md with Claude Code
"Claude, let's start working on the tasks in TASKS.md"
```

**Daily Progress**

- Check off completed tasks
- Update TASKS.md
- Commit changes regularly
- Run tests frequently

### 6. Sprint Review (Day 10)

**Archive Sprint**

```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p docs/spec-kit/archive/sprint-XXX

# Archive documents
cp docs/spec-kit/{spec.md,PLAN.md,TASKS.md} \
   docs/spec-kit/archive/sprint-XXX/

# Archive constitution version
cp docs/constitution.md \
   docs/spec-kit/archive/sprint-XXX/constitution-vX.X.X.md
```

**Create Sprint Summary**

```bash
# Generate summary with Claude
"Claude, create a SPRINT_SUMMARY.md for sprint-XXX"
```

### 7. Sprint Retrospective

**Update CHANGELOG**

```bash
# Document changes
"Claude, update CHANGELOG.md with sprint-XXX changes"
```

**Identify Improvements**

- What went well?
- What could improve?
- Action items for next sprint

## Iterative SpecKit + PRP Workflow

### The Pair Programming Approach

SpecKit processes the constitution through Docker, and we iterate together to generate PRPs and specifications. This is a **collaborative workflow** between you, the AI assistant, and SpecKit's Docker processing.

### Phase 0: Constitution Processing with SpecKit

1. **Feed Constitution to SpecKit**

```bash
# Copy constitution to container
docker cp ../constitution.md speckit-dev:/workspace/constitution.md

# Run SpecKit's PowerShell script
docker compose exec speckit pwsh -File /workspace/.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 \
  -InputFilePath /workspace/constitution.md \
  -FeatureName "Sprint-3-Features"
```

2. **SpecKit Generates Basic Structure**

SpecKit creates:

- `.specify/features/Sprint-3-Features/spec.md` (basic specification)
- Includes the full constitution for reference
- Provides initial structure for enhancement

3. **AI Enhancement Phase** (This is where PRPs come from!)

```bash
# Review SpecKit's output
docker compose exec speckit cat /workspace/.specify/features/Sprint-3-Features/spec.md

# Use AI to analyze and generate PRPs from the output
"Claude, analyze the SpecKit output and identify major features that need PRPs"
```

4. **Generate PRPs from SpecKit Output**

The AI assistant:

- Reads SpecKit's processed constitution
- Identifies major features (forms, integrations, etc.)
- Generates PRPs for each major feature
- Places them in `prp/inbox/`

```bash
# AI generates PRPs based on SpecKit analysis
/generate-prp Based on SpecKit output, create PRP for Web3Forms integration
/generate-prp Based on SpecKit output, create PRP for Firebase Auth
/generate-prp Based on SpecKit output, create PRP for Stripe Payment
```

5. **Review and Refine PRPs**

```bash
# Human review of generated PRPs
cat prp/inbox/web3forms-integration-prp.md
# Edit if needed
vim prp/inbox/web3forms-integration-prp.md
# Move to outbox when ready
mv prp/inbox/*.prp.md prp/outbox/
```

### The Complete Iterative Flow

```
Constitution ‚Üí SpecKit (Docker) ‚Üí Basic Spec ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí PRPs ‚Üí
‚Üí Enhanced Spec ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implementation
```

**Key Insights**:

- SpecKit provides the initial processing via Docker
- AI enhances SpecKit's output to generate PRPs
- PRPs are OUTPUT from the SpecKit+AI collaboration
- This is an iterative pair programming process
- Each phase builds on the previous one

## Key Commands Reference

### Docker Setup

```bash
cd docs/spec-kit
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec speckit bash
```

### Spec Kit CLI vs AI Assistant Commands

#### CLI Tool (specify)

```bash
# Initialize new project only
specify init PROJECT_NAME --here
specify init PROJECT_NAME --ai claude  # Specify AI assistant
```

#### AI Assistant Commands (Claude, Copilot, Gemini)

```
# These are used in your AI chat interface, NOT in terminal:
/specify [description]  # Generate specification
/plan [requirements]    # Create technical plan
/tasks                  # Break down into tasks
```

**IMPORTANT**: The `specify` CLI tool only initializes projects. All spec/plan/task generation is done through AI assistant commands in your chat interface.

### Claude Code Integration

```bash
# Edit constitution
"Claude, update constitution.md for our new requirements"

# Create specifications
"Claude, create spec.md for [feature description]"

# Review and refine
"Claude, review spec-output.md and enhance it"

# Implementation
"Claude, implement the tasks in TASKS.md"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Version Control

- Commit after each major phase
- Use semantic versioning for constitution
- Tag sprint completions

### 2. Documentation

- Always create SPRINT_SUMMARY.md
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Document decisions in commits

### 3. Review Points

- Never skip human review phases
- Edit generated content before proceeding
- Validate against constitution principles

### 4. Testing

- Test after each feature implementation
- Run full test suite before sprint completion
- Document test results in summary

### 5. Communication

- Clear task descriptions
- Detailed commit messages
- Comprehensive sprint summaries

## Sprint Metrics to Track

- Tasks completed vs planned
- Time per task category
- Test coverage changes
- Performance metrics
- Bug count
- Technical debt items

## Continuous Improvement

Each sprint should:

1. Deliver working features
2. Improve code quality
3. Enhance documentation
4. Refine the process
5. Update the constitution

## Transition Checklist
