# Spec Kit Sprint Changelog

All notable changes to this project's sprint iterations are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project's constitution follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Sprint-002] - Planned
### Goals
- Enhanced testing coverage (80% target)
- User authentication system
- Form provider integrations
- Performance optimizations
- Real-time error tracking

### Constitution Changes
- TBD based on Sprint-001 learnings

## [Sprint-001] - 2025-09-01 to 2025-09-10
### Sprint Goal
Build the complete foundation of CRUDkit as a universal PWA meta-template

### Added
- **Core Application** - Next.js 15.5 with Turbopack, TypeScript strict mode
- **Theme System** - 32 DaisyUI themes with OKLCH color system
- **Component Gallery** - 25+ atomic design components with Storybook
- **Accessibility Controls** - Font size, line height, contrast, motion preferences
- **PWA Features** - Service worker, offline support, installable app
- **Monitoring Dashboard** - Progress tracking, Lighthouse scores, deployment history
- **Testing Suite** - Vitest setup, component testing framework
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions, dual deployment (App + Storybook)
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive README, Spec Kit tutorial, architecture docs
- **Docker Support** - Full containerization for development

### Changed
- Migrated from create-next-app template to fully custom implementation
- Replaced default styling with Tailwind + DaisyUI
- Enhanced constitution.md with reference templates and clear principles

### Fixed
- Hydration mismatches in date formatting
- Theme persistence across page navigation
- Service worker caching strategies
- Build warnings for metadata exports

### Constitution Version
- **v1.0.0** - Initial constitution with complete rewrite
  - Reduced from 446 to 170 lines (62% reduction)
  - Added reference templates (Punk_Stack, 001_template, 000_Template)
  - Established PRP→Spec→Implementation workflow
  - Defined 6-level validation loops

### Metrics
- **Tasks Completed**: 96/96 (100%)
- **Components Created**: 25+
- **Themes Implemented**: 32
- **Lighthouse Scores**: 90+ across all metrics
- **Bundle Size**: ~102KB First Load JS
- **Build Time**: <30 seconds
- **Lines of Code**: ~15,000

### Lessons Learned
1. **Spec Kit Workflow** - Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks provides excellent structure
2. **Human Review Critical** - Each phase needs review and refinement before proceeding
3. **Hydration Challenges** - Server/client date formatting needs careful handling
4. **Theme System Success** - OKLCH provides superior color manipulation
5. **PWA Complexity** - Service workers require careful cache strategy planning
6. **Component Architecture** - Atomic design scales well for large projects
7. **Docker Benefits** - Consistent environment eliminates "works on my machine"

### Technical Debt Identified
- Missing test coverage (currently at setup phase)
- Bundle size optimization opportunities
- Code splitting not fully implemented
- Some ESLint warnings to address
- Performance optimizations for large lists

### Process Improvements
- Need better task estimation (story points)
- More granular git commits
- Earlier integration testing
- Daily progress reviews would help
- Sprint planning meetings before starting

1. **Sprint Duration**: 1-2 weeks
2. **Document Archiving**: Complete sprint history preserved
3. **Constitution Evolution**: Versioned updates based on learnings
4. **Review Checkpoints**: Human review at each phase
5. **Metrics Tracking**: Comprehensive sprint summaries

## Future Sprint Planning
- **Sprint-002**: Testing & Authentication (Planned)
