# Spec Kit Sprint Changelog

All notable changes to this project's sprint iterations are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project's constitution follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Sprint-002] - Started 2025-09-11
### Sprint Goal
Fix the Foundation - 10-week sprint to establish testing, quality gates, and developer experience

### Planned (65 Tasks)
- **Weeks 1-2**: Testing Foundation - Vitest, first tests, pre-commit hooks, CI pipeline
- **Weeks 3-4**: Developer Experience - Docker HMR fix, Prettier, Dependabot, error handling
- **Weeks 5-6**: First Simple Feature - Dice component with tests and Storybook
- **Weeks 7-8**: Quality Baseline - Zod validation, security docs, 25% coverage target
- **Weeks 9-10**: Foundation Completion - Health checks, accessibility testing, performance monitoring

### Constitution Changes
- **v2.2.0** - Added reality check showing ~40% actual compliance
- Clarified spec-kit commands are AI assistant commands, not CLI
- Fixed duplicate section numbering
- Expanded Sprint 2 from 3 weeks to 10 weeks based on realistic assessment

## [Sprint-001] - 2025-09-01 to 2025-09-11
### Sprint Goal  
Initial foundation setup and discovery phase

### Reality Check
- **Claimed Completion**: 100% (per original constitution)
- **Actual Completion**: ~40% (discovered through audit)

### Actually Completed
- **Core Application** - Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router setup
- **Theme System** - 32 DaisyUI themes working
- **Basic Components** - Initial atomic structure
- **PWA Features** - Service worker and manifest
- **Docker Support** - Two containers (crudkit & speckit)
- **GitHub Pages** - Basic deployment working

### Not Completed (Despite Claims)
- **Testing Infrastructure** - 0% coverage, no tests written
- **Quality Gates** - No pre-commit hooks or CI checks
- **Input Validation** - No Zod or validation framework
- **Error Handling** - No error boundaries
- **Security** - No security documentation or CSP
- **Accessibility Testing** - No Pa11y or automated testing
- **Performance Monitoring** - No Web Vitals collection

### Major Discoveries
1. **Package Manager Confusion** - Both npm and pnpm lock files existed
2. **Spec-Kit Misunderstanding** - /specify, /plan, /tasks are AI chat commands, NOT CLI
3. **Constitution Drift** - Claims didn't match reality

### Process Changes
- Standardized on pnpm exclusively (removed package-lock.json)
- Clarified spec-kit workflow in all documentation
- Added reality check section to constitution
- Expanded Sprint 2 from 3 weeks to realistic 10 weeks

### Technical Debt Identified
- **Critical**: No testing (0% coverage), no quality gates, no validation
- **Important**: Docker HMR broken, missing error boundaries, no security docs
- **Nice to Have**: Component generator, visual regression, E2E framework

### Process Improvements
- Need better task estimation (story points)
- More granular git commits
- Earlier integration testing
- Daily progress reviews would help
- Sprint planning meetings before starting
